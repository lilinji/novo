Cluster Grid Engine HOWTO: Job management

Show the list of execution hosts and the list of queues
 qconf -sel
 qconf -sql   
Show the configuration of a queue
 qconf -sq all.q 

Show the states of a queue
 ?a (alarm) - At least one of the load thresholds defined in the load_thresholds list of the queue configuration is currently exceeded. This state prevents N1GE from scheduling further jobs to that queue. For more information, see the queue_confman page. ?au state might be an indicator for a shutdown host
 
?A (Alarm) - At least one of the suspend thresholds of the queue is currently exceeded. This state causes jobs running in that queue to be successively suspended until no threshold is violated. For more information, see the queue_conf man page.
 ?c (configuration ambiguous) - The queue instance configuration specified using sge_conf is ambiguous. The state resolves when the configuration becomes unambiguous again. This state prevents you from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance. You can find detailed reasons why a queue instance entered this state in the sge_qmaster messages file. You can also see the reasons using the qstat command with -explain. For queue instances in this state, the cluster queue's default settings are used for the ambiguous attribute.
 ?C (Calendar suspended) - The queue has been disabled or suspended automatically using the N1GE calendar facility. See the calendar_conf man page for more information.
 ?d (disabled) - This setting is assigned to queues and released using the qmod command. Suspending a queue will suspend all jobs executing in that queue.
 ?D (Disabled) - The queue has been disabled or suspended automatically using the N1GE calendar facility. See the calendar_conf man page for more information.
 ?E (Error) - This setting appears when the N1GE daemon (sge_execd) on that host was unable to locate the sge_shepherd executable on that host in order to start a job. Check that daemon's error log for information how to resolve the problem. Enable the queue afterwards using the qmod command with the -c option (e.g., qmod -c all.q). To get explanations of E state, use qstat -explain E -qs E
 ?o (orphaned) - The current cluster queue's configuration and host group configuration no longer needs this queue instance. The queue instance is kept because unfinished jobs are still associated with it. The orphaned state prevents you from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance. It disappears from qstat output when these jobs finish. To help resolve an orphaned queue instance associated with a job, use the qdel command. You can revive an orphaned queue instance by changing the cluster queue configuration so that the configuration covers that queue instance.
 ?s (suspended) - Assigned to queues and released using the qmod command. Suspending a queue suspends all jobs executing in that queue.
 ?S (Subordinate) - The queue has been suspend due to subordination to another queue. See queue_conf for details. When suspending a queue, regardless of the cause, all jobs executing in that queue are suspended too.
 ?u (unknown) - The corresponding sge_execd(8) cannot be contacted.
 
Increase job priority
 
As root (or Grid Engine administrator), you can increase/decrease the priority of a job:
 # increase priority to bypass jobs earlier in queue
qalter -p 255 jobid 
Suspend and resubmit stalled jobs
 # as user:qstat | grep neteler | tr -s ' ' ' '  | cut -d' ' -f2 > /tmp/to_suspend.sgecat /tmp/to_suspend.sge# as root (?):su -for i in `cat /tmp/to_suspend.sge` ; do qmod -sj $i ; doneqstat# remove crashed blade from list of execution hosts:qconf -de blade14# delete host from list:qconf -mhgrp "@allhosts"# apply new list:qconf -shgrp "@allhosts"# verify queue stats:qstat -f# resubmit jobs to other nodes (as job user!!):exitfor i in `cat /tmp/to_suspend.sge` ; do qresub $i ; doneqstat 
Delete all your jobs
 
Ops, you discovered that you launched tons of jobs with a bug in your processing script? You can easily delete all your jobs (your login name is stored in the system variable $USER):
 qdel -u $USER 
Reactive broken blade
 
todo
 [root@head ~]# qconf -mhgrp "@allhosts"root@head modified "@allhosts" in host group list[root@head ~]# qconf -shgrp "@allhosts"group_name @allhosts hostlist c00 c01 c02[root@head ~]# ssh c01 "/etc/init.d/sgeexecd stop ; /etc/init.d/sgeexecd start" 
Taking a node temporarily out
 
Sometimes a blade struggles, so it needs to be blacklisted.

Delete the execution host "foo":
 qconf -de foo 
Add host foo back to the execution list.
 qconf -ae foo 

Qstat errors: states Eqw and E

 State Eqw: If your Grid Engine job is hanging with an Eqw state, try running: 
   qstat -j This will give you more than enough information to work with and usually the root cause of your problem - usually path errors.

State E: Some job is hanging. Get info with
     qstat -explain E -qs E  查看错误节点。

Note: State "E" does not go away automatically To globally clear all E states in your SGE cluster WHEN YOU ARE SURE that this is ok:

 qmod -c '*' See also here.  清除楚错误

 
Multi-queue management: Suspend and resume queues
 
Suspend a queue (add -f in case sge_execd is not reachable):

 qmod -s q_name1 

Suspend two queues (add -f in case sge_execd is not reachable):

 qmod -s q_name1, q_name2 

Resumes (unsuspend) a queue:
 qmod -us -f q_name1 

Disable/Enable a particular queue for some reason
 ... for example for maintenance... Disable a particular queue: qconf -sql  # add -f in case sge_execd is not reachable qmod -d q_name 
To enable back the queue:

 qmod -e q_name 

Wildcards can be used to specify a range of queues:

 qmod -e q_name* 
Accounting
 You can obtain usage statistics with "qacct":
 qacct -o 
Statistics are generated by all jobs that have completed and that are contained in the in the cluster accounting file $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/accounting. In this case, qacct reports on the following:
 ?WALLCLOCK C Wall clock time, which is the time between when the job starts and when it finishes in seconds
 ?UTIME C CPU time spent in user processes in seconds
 ?STIME C CPU time spent in system calls in seconds
 ?CPU C CPU time usage in seconds
 ?MEMORY C The integral memory usage in Gbytes CPU seconds
 ?IO C The amount of data transferred in input/output operations
 ?IOW C The input/output wait time in seconds
